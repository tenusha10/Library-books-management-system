The program is run through the menu.py file which contains all the GUI. To use the search the user has to type in the search word and press submit which is directly next to the input button. Same with book checkout the user types in user ID and book ID on the input box and press submit. The code to checkout will not execute until user ID and Book ID are both in correct format. To use book return the user has to type in one book IDs ( one at a time ) into the input box and press submit then input the next one so on... then the user has to input 0 and press submit(one last time) to execute the code to return books(this is also built to take a list of book IDs( one after the other) and the loop terminates when '0' is inputted. To use Book weed the user can weed out all the books that fit the criteria by entering yes onto input box and clicking submit button. If user only want to weed out specific book IDs they can use the input box and button (add to list) directly below and use the same concept as book return to enter a list of book IDs and enter '0' to execute code. Warnings when running test scripts on modules some tests are all run at the same time but some you have to specify which test you would like to run (only in book return module). Be advised: Program has to be 'Killed' after some tests are executed is executed also some tests will cause non-reversible changes such as weed function as it will remove records from the database. I am proud that I have completed all the coursework hopefully i have done well as this is my first time in python also considering the test not going well for me and I have also done a fully functional GUI to go beyond the specification.
